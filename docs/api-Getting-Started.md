p5ML.js is heavily inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and therefore, is meant to make machine learning accessible to artists, designers, educators and beginners by providing a simple and intuitive interface to common ML capabilities.

## Setup

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ml5-js) of p5ML.js and save the following HTML file to your computer:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset=utf-8>
      <title>Intro to p5ML.js</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <script src="libraries/p5ML.min.js"></script>
      <script>
        // Your code will go here 
      </script>
    </body>
  </html>
```

That's all!
