## Description

ml5.js has created an API to [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/blob/master/README.md) that allows you to access face and face landmark detection.  

The ml5.js implementation of face-api does not support `expressions`, `age` or `gender` estimation.

## Quickstart

```js
const detectionOptions = {
  withLandmarks: true,
  withDescriptors: false,
};
// Initialize the magicFeature
const faceapi = ml5.faceApi(detectionOptions, modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');

  // Make some sparkles
  faceapi.detect(myImage, (err, results) => {
    console.log(results);
  });
}


```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const faceapi = ml5.faceApi(videoOrOptionsOrCallback, optionsOrCallback?, callback?);
```

#### Parameters
* **videoOrOptionsOrCallback**: REQUIRED. Notice there is no question mark in front of the input.
* **optionsOrCallback**: OPTIONAL. Notice the `?` indicates an optional parameter.
* **callback**: OPTIONAL. A description of some kind of object with some properties. Notice the `?` indicates an optional parameter.

  ```js
  {
    withLandmarks: true,
    withDescriptors: true,
    minConfidence: 0.5,
    MODEL_URLS: {
      Mobilenetv1Model: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/main/models/faceapi/ssd_mobilenetv1_model-weights_manifest.json',
      FaceLandmarkModel: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/main/models/faceapi/face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json',
      FaceLandmark68TinyNet: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/main/models/faceapi/face_landmark_68_tiny_model-weights_manifest.json',
      FaceRecognitionModel: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/main/models/faceapi/face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json',
    },
  };
  ```

### Properties

***
#### .video
> **Object**: An HTML5Video object if one is passed in the constructor
***

***
#### .model
> **Object**: the model
***

***
#### .modelReady
> **Boolean**: true when model is ready and loaded, false when it is not
***

***
#### .config
> **Object** object of configurations of the model
***

***
#### .ready
> **Boolean**: true when model is ready and loaded, false when it is not
***



### Methods


***
#### .detect()
> Given an image, will run face detection. If a video was passed in the constructor, then it only a callback is necessary to handle the results.

```js
faceapi.detect(optionsOrCallback, configOrCallback, callback);
```

üì• **Inputs**

* **optionsOrCallback**: Required. Image | Object | Function. If given an image, this is the image that the face detection will be applied. If given an object, it is to set the configuration. If given a callback, this is to handle the results of the `.detect()` method.
* **configOrCallback**: Optional. Object | Function. If an image is given as the first parameter, then this will either be an object or a function. If given an object, it is to set the configuration. If given a callback, this is to handle the results of the `.detect()` method.
* **callback**: Optional. Function. A function to handle the results of `.makeSparkles()`. Likely a function to do something with the results of makeSparkles.

üì§ **Outputs**

* **Array**: Returns an array of objects. Each object contains `{alignedRect, detection, landmarks, unshiftedLandmarks}`.

***

***
#### .detectSingle()
> Given an image, will run face detection. If a video was passed in the constructor, then it only a callback is necessary to handle the results. `.detectSingle()` is more accurate.

```js
faceapi.detectSingle(optionsOrCallback, configOrCallback, callback);
```

üì• **Inputs**
* **optionsOrCallback**: Required. Image | Object | Function. If given an image, this is the image that the face detection will be applied. If given an object, it is to set the configuration. If given a callback, this is to handle the results of the `.detect()` method.
* **configOrCallback**: Optional. Object | Function. If an image is given as the first parameter, then this will either be an object or a function. If given an object, it is to set the configuration. If given a callback, this is to handle the results of the `.detect()` method.
* **callback**: Optional. Function. A function to handle the results of `.makeSparkles()`. Likely a function to do something with the results of makeSparkles.

üì§ **Outputs**

* **Array**: Returns an array of objects. Each object contains `{alignedRect, detection, landmarks, unshiftedLandmarks}`.

### Models Overview

FaceApi provides the following five pre-trained model options for different tasks: MobilenetV1, TinyFaceDetector, FaceLandmarkModel, FaceLandmark68TinyNet, and FaceRecognitionModel.

Each model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN finds patterns in the pixels of images (e.g. horizontal or vertical edges), and through successive layers of computation finds sets of patterns to identify more complex patterns (e.g. corners or circles), eventually detecting intricate patterns that it predicts belong to a particular category (e.g. a face or a point on a face). The categories depend on how images in the model‚Äôs training dataset are labeled. In the case of the face recognition model, the ‚Äúmodel is not limited to the set of faces used for training, meaning you can use it for face recognition of any person‚Äù because the model has been trained to  ‚Äúdetermine the similarity of two arbitrary faces by comparing their face descriptors (source).‚Äù 


#### MobilenetV1 and TinyFaceDetector - Model Biography

- **Description**
  - These models detect faces in images and video. TinyFaceDetector is smaller, faster, and mobile-friendly, but potentially less accurate.
- **Developer and Year**
  - These models are actively developed for the browser by Vincent M√ºhler, beginning in 2018. Technical information about models‚Äô architectures are available in the face-api.js GitHub repository.
  - M√ºhler writes that the model‚Äôs weights were retrieved from a GitHub repository hosted by yeephycho, who also used the WIDER FACE dataset. (Weights are the parameters that machine learning neural networks use to perform a task, such as to predict features, or patterns, in a dataset. Weights are the values that exist in the connections between the layers of a network. At each layer, a mathematical function is applied to these values to output new values for the subsequent layer and eventually generate a final prediction for the result.)
