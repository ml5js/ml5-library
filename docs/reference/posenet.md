## Description

PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

The original PoseNet model was ported to TensorFlow.js by Dan Oved. For background, read [Real-time Human Pose Estimation in the Browser with TensorFlow.js](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5).

## Quickstart

```js
const video = document.getElementById('video');

// Create a new poseNet method
const poseNet = ml5.poseNet(video, modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
}
// Listen to new 'pose' events
poseNet.on('pose', (results) => {
  poses = results;
});
```


## Usage

### Initialize
There are a couple ways to initialize `ml5.poseNet`.
```js
// Initialize with video, type and callback
const poseNet = ml5.poseNet(?video, ?type, ?callback);
// OR Initialize with video, options and callback
const poseNet = ml5.poseNet(?video, ?options, ?callback);
// OR Initialize WITHOUT video. Just options and callback here
const poseNet = ml5.poseNet(?callback, ?options);
```

#### Parameters
* **video**: OPTIONAL. Optional HTMLVideoElement input to run poses on.
* **type**: OPTIONAL. A String value to run `single` or `multiple` estimation. Changes the `detectionType` property of the options. Default is `multiple`.
* **callback**: OPTIONAL. A function that is called when the model is loaded.
* **options**: OPTIONAL. A object that contains properties that effect the posenet model accuracy, results, etc.

  ```js
  {
    architecture: 'MobileNetV1',
    imageScaleFactor: 0.3,
    outputStride: 16,
    flipHorizontal: false,
    minConfidence: 0.5,
    maxPoseDetections: 5,
    scoreThreshold: 0.5,
    nmsRadius: 20,
    detectionType: 'multiple',
    inputResolution: 513,
    multiplier: 0.75,
    quantBytes: 2,
  };
  ```

### Properties

***
#### .net
> The poseNet model
***

***
#### .video
> The optional video added to the
***

***
#### .architecture
> The model architecture
***

***
#### .detectionType
> The detection type
***

***
#### .imageScaleFactor
> The image scale factor
***

***
#### .outputStride
> Can be one of 8, 16, 32 (Stride 16, 32 are supported for the ResNet architecture and stride 8, 16, 32 are supported for the MobileNetV1 architecture). It specifies the output stride of the PoseNet model. The smaller the value, the larger the output resolution, and more accurate the model at the cost of speed. Set this to a larger value to increase speed at the cost of accuracy.
***

***
#### .flipHorizontal
> Boolean. Flip the image horizontal or not.
***

***
#### .scoreThreshold
> The threshold for returned values. Between 0 and 1. Only return instance detections that have root part score greater or equal to this value. Defaults to 0.5.
***


***
#### .maxPoseDetections
> the maximum number of poses to detect. Defaults to 5.
***

***
#### .multiplier
> Can be one of 1.01, 1.0, 0.75, or 0.50 (The value is used only by the MobileNetV1 architecture and not by the ResNet architecture). It is the float multiplier for the depth (number of channels) for all convolution ops. The larger the value, the larger the size of the layers, and more accurate the model at the cost of speed. Set this to a smaller value to increase speed at the cost of accuracy.
***

***
#### .inputResolution
> Can be one of 161, 193, 257, 289, 321, 353, 385, 417, 449, 481, 513, and 801. Defaults to 257. It specifies the size the image is resized to before it is fed into the PoseNet model. The larger the value, the more accurate the model at the cost of speed. Set this to a smaller value to increase speed at the cost of accuracy.
***

***
#### .quantBytes
>This argument controls the bytes used for weight quantization. The available options are: 4. 4 bytes per float (no quantization). Leads to highest accuracy and original model size (~90MB). 2. 2 bytes per float. Leads to slightly lower accuracy and 2x model size reduction (~45MB). 1. 1 byte per float. Leads to lower accuracy and 4x model size reduction (~22MB).
***

***
#### .nmsRadius
> Non-maximum suppression part distance. It needs to be strictly positive. Two parts suppress each other if they are less than nmsRadius pixels away. Defaults to 20.
***


### Methods

***
#### .on('pose', ...)
> An event listener that returns the results when a pose is detected. You can use this with `.singlePose()` or `.multiPose()` or just listen for poses if you pass in a `video` into the constructor.

```js
poseNet.on('pose', callback);
```

üì• **Inputs**

* **callback**: REQUIRED.  A callback function to handle the results when a pose is detected. For example.

```js
poseNet.on('pose', (results) => {
  // do something with the results
  console.log(results);
});
```

üì§ **Outputs**

* **Array**: Returns an array of objects. See documentation for `.singlePose()` and `.multiPose()`

#### .singlePose()
> Given a number, will make magicSparkles

```js
poseNet.singlePose(?input);

### Models Overview

There are two model versions available for use with ml5‚Äôs implementation of PoseNet, ‚ÄúMobileNetV1‚Äù and ‚ÄúResNet50.‚Äù 

Each model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN finds patterns in the pixels of images (e.g. horizontal or vertical edges), and through successive layers of computation finds sets of patterns to identify more complex patterns (e.g. corners or circles), eventually detecting intricate patterns that it predicts belong to a particular category (e.g. right eye or left elbow). The categories depend on how images in the model‚Äôs training dataset are labeled.

#### MobileNetV1 - Model Biography

* **Description**
  * MobileNet is a term that describes a type of machine learning model architecture that has been optimized to run on platforms with limited computational power, such as applications on mobile or embedded devices. MobileNets have several use cases, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. This particular MobileNet model was trained to detect people and 17 different key points on the body.
  * ml5 defaults using a MobileNet created with TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library from TensorFlow, an open source machine learning platform developed by Google.
* **Developer and Year**
  * Google‚Äôs TensorFlow.js team. The TensorFlow version was ported to TensorFlow.js by Dan Oved in collaboration with Google Researchers, George Papandreou and [Tyler (Lixuan) Zhu](https://research.google/people/TylerZhu/).
* **Purpose and Intended Users**
  * From the website: TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform that ‚Äúhas a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.‚Äù This model is available for use in the ml5 library because Tensorflow licenses it with Apache License 2.0.
* **Hosted Location**
  * As of June 2019, ml5 imports MobileNetV1 from TensorFlow, hosted on the NPM database. This means that your ml5 sketch will automatically use the most recent version distributed on NPM.

#### ResNet50 - Model Biography

- **Description**
  - ResNet is a term that describes a type of machine learning model architecture that contains more computational layers than a MobileNet model. Because of its larger size, it is slower but yields more accurate results. 
  - As of PoseNet 2.0, a ResNet50 model version is available to import from TensorFlow and may be specified in your ml5 script.
- **Developer and Year**
  - Google‚Äôs TensorFlow.js team
- **Purpose and Intended Users**
  - Same as above
- **Hosted Location**
  - ml5 imports ResNet50 from TensorFlow, hosted on the NPM database. This means that if you specify ResNet in your ml5 sketch, it will automatically use the most recent version distributed on NPM.
