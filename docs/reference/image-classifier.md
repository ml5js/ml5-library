## Description
You can use neural networks to recognize the content of images. `ml5.imageClassifier()` is a method to create an object that classifies an image using a pre-trained model.

It should be noted that the pre-trained model provided by the example below was trained on a database of approximately 15 million images (ImageNet). The ml5 library accesses this model from the cloud. What the algorithm labels an image is entirely dependent on that training data -- what is included, excluded, and how those images are labeled (or mislabeled).

**Train your own image classification model with Teachable Machine**: If you'd like to train your own custom image classification model, try [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/io19).

## Quickstart

```js
// Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet
const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', modelLoaded);

// When the model is loaded
function modelLoaded() {
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
}

// Make a prediction with a selected image
classifier.classify(document.getElementById('image'), (err, results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(model, ?video, ?options, ?callback);
```

#### Parameters
* **model**: REQUIRED. A String value of a valid model OR a url to a model.json that contains a pre-trained model. Case insensitive. Models available are: 'MobileNet', 'Darknet' and 'Darknet-tiny','DoodleNet', or any image classification model trained in Teachable Machine. Below are some examples of creating a new image classifier:
  * `mobilenet`:
    ```js
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', modelReady);
    ```
  * `Darknet`:
    ```js
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('Darknet', modelReady);
    ```
  * `DoodleNet`:
    ```js
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('DoodleNet', modelReady);
    ```
  * Custom Model from Teachable Machine:
    ```js
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('path/to/custom/model.json', modelReady);
    ```
* **video**: OPTIONAL. An HTMLVideoElement
* **callback**: OPTIONAL. A function to run once the model has been loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.
* **options**: OPTIONAL. An object to change the defaults (shown below). The available options are:
  ```js
  {
    version: 1,
    alpha: 1.0,
    topk: 3,
  };
  ```

### Properties


***
#### .video
> *Object*. HTMLVideoElement if given in the constructor. Otherwise it is null.
***

***
#### .model
> *Object*. The image classifier model specified in the constructor.
***

***
#### .modelName
> *String*. The name of the image classifier model specified in the constructor
***

***
#### .modelUrl
> *String*. The absolute or relative URL path to the input model.
***


### Methods

***
#### .classify()
> Given an image or video, returns an array of objects containing class names and probabilities

If you DID NOT specify an image or video in the constructor...
```js
classifier.classify(input, ?numberOfClasses, ?callback);
```

If you DID specify an image or video in the constructor...
```js
classifier.classify(?numberOfClasses , ?callback);
```

üì• **Inputs**

* **input**: HTMLImageElement | ImageData | HTMLCanvasElement | HTMLVideoElement. NOTE: Videos can also be added in the constructor and then do not need to be specified again as an input.
* **numberOfClasses**: Number. The number of classes you want to return.
* **callback**: Function. A function to handle the results of `.segment()`. Likely a function to do something with the segmented image.

üì§ **Outputs**

* **Object**: Returns an array of objects. Each object contains `{label, confidence}`.

  - MobileNet is a term that describes a type of machine learning model architecture that has been optimized to run on platforms with limited computational power, such as applications on mobile or embedded devices. MobileNets have several use cases including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. This particular MobileNet model was trained for Image Classification.
  - ml5 uses a MobileNet created with TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library from TensorFlow. Several TensorFlow.js MobileNet versions are available for image classification, and as of June 2019, ml5 defaults to importing MobileNetV2.
- **Developer and Year**
  - Google‚Äôs Tensorflow.js team
- **Purpose and Intended Users**
  - From the website: TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform that ‚Äúhas a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.‚Äù This model is available for use in the ml5 library because Tensorflow licenses it with Apache License 2.0.
- **Hosted Location**
  - ml5 imports MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow, hosted on the NPM database, however a different version may be specified in your ml5 script. For whichever you specify, your ml5 sketch will automatically use the most recent version distributed on NPM.
