# CVAE: Conditional Variational Autoencoder


## Description

An autoencoder is an neural network that learns how to encode data (like the pixels of an image) into a smaller representation. This is akin to image compression (although classic image compression algorithms are better!) A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) takes this idea one step further and is trained to generate new images in the style of training data by sprinkling in a little bit of randomness. Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is an extension of this idea, with the ability to be more specific about what is generated. From [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdpbnd0pCiI), the author explains that: <br/>

*\"Autoencoders are neural networks that are capable of creating sparse representations of the input data and can therefore be used for image compression. There are denoising autoencoders that after learning these sparse representations, can be presented with noisy images. What is even better is a variant that is called the variational autoencoder that not only learns these sparse representations, but can also draw new images as well. We can, for instance, ask it to create new handwritten digits and we can actually expect the results to make sense!"*


## Quickstart

```js
const cvae = ml5.CVAE('model/quick_draw/manifest.json', modelReady);

function modelReady() {
  // generate an image of an airplane
  cvae.generate('airplane', gotImage);
}

function gotImage(error, result) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return;
  }
  // log the result
  console.log(result);
}
```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const magic = ml5.CVAE(?model, ?callback);
```

#### Parameters
* **model**: REQUIRED. The url path to your model. Can be an absolute or relative path.
* **callback**: REQUIRED. A function to run once the model has been loaded.


### Properties

***
#### .ready
> *BOOLEAN*. Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.
***


### Methods


***
#### .generate(label, callback);
> Given a label, will generate an image.

```js
cvae.generate(label, callback);
```

üì• **Inputs**

* **label**: REQUIRED. String. A label of the feature your want to generate.
* **callback**: REQUIRED. Function. A function to handle the results of ".generate()". Likely a function to do something with the generated image data.

üì§ **Outputs**

* **Object**: Returns "raw", "blob", and "tensor". If p5.js is available, a "p5Image" will be returned as well.

#### CVAE - Data Biography

- **Description**
  - You provide images for training the model from Google‚Äôs Google‚Äôs Quick, Draw! Dataset. See Dingsu (Derek) Wang‚Äôs tutorial in the ml5 GitHub repository on how to train a ml5 CVAE model using your own dataset from that source. 
- **Source**
  - Google‚Äôs Quick, Draw! Dataset
- **Collector and Year**
  - From the website: Google released the Quick, Draw! game in 2016 and was developed as ‚Äúan example of how you can use machine learning in fun ways‚Äù by the Google Creative Lab, Data Arts Team, and their collaborators as part of Google‚Äôs AI Experiments showcase.
- **Collection Method**
  - The sketches are crowdsourced from visitors‚Äô contributions as they play Google‚Äôs Quick, Draw! Game, and they are publicly available to download.
- **Purpose and Intended Users**
  - According to the paper, the dataset is publicly available ‚Äúto encourage further research and development in the area of generative vector image modelling.‚Äù
