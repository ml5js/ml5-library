## Description

Sentiment is a model trained to predict the sentiment of any given text. The default model, currently 'moviereviews', is trained using IMDB reviews that have been truncated to a maximum of 200 words, only the 20000 most used words in the reviews are used.

## Quickstart

```js
// Create a new Sentiment method
const sentiment = ml5.sentiment('movieReviews', modelReady);

// When the model is loaded
function modelReady() {
  // model is ready
  console.log('Model Loaded!');
}

// make the prediction
const prediction = sentiment.predict(text);
console.log(prediction);
```


## Usage

### Initialize

```js
const sentiment = ml5.sentiment(model, ?callback);
```

#### Parameters
* **model**: REQUIRED. Defaults to 'moviereviews'. You can also use a path to a `manifest.json` file via a relative or absolute path.
* **callback**: OPTIONAL. A callback function that is called once the model has loaded. If no callback is provided, it will return a promise that will be resolved once the model has loaded.


### Properties

***
#### .ready
> Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.
***

***
#### .model
> The model being used.
***


### Methods


***
#### .predict()
> Given a number, will make magicSparkles

```js
sentiment.predict(text);
```

üì• **Inputs**

* **text**: Required. String. A string of text to predict


üì§ **Outputs**

* **Object**: Scores the sentiment of given text with a value between 0 ("negative") and 1 ("positive").

### Models Overview

A nice description of the models overview

#### Sentiment - Movie reviews - Model Biography

- **Description**
  - This a pre-trained model to detect whether the sentiment of text is positive or negative. 
- **Developer and Year**
  - Google‚Äôs TensorFlow.js team. TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library from TensorFlow, an open source machine learning platform developed by Google.
- **Purpose and Intended Users**
  - From the website: TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform that ‚Äúhas a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.‚Äù This model is available for use in the ml5 library because Tensorflow licenses it with Apache License 2.0.
- **Hosted Location**
  - It is hosted by Google and imported into ml5 from Google‚Äôs collection of Tensorflow.js models.

#### Sentiment - Movie reviews - Data Biography

- **Description**
  - According to the original description on this ml5 reference page, the TensorFlow.js Sentiment Analysis example, the example‚Äôs source citation, the training dataset likely consists of 25,000 highly-polarized IMDB reviews. 
- **Source**
  - The TensorFlow.js example cites the data source as Keras, ‚Äúa deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow‚Äù and ‚Äúdeveloped with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.‚Äù Keras in turn cites the source as the Large Movie Review Dataset.
- **Collector and Year**
  - The Large Movie Review Dataset was created at Stanford University by Andrew Maas in 2011.
- **Collection Method**
  - TBD
- **Purpose and Intended Users**
  - The Large Movie Review Dataset was created for research in the area of Computational Linguistics
