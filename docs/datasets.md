## Ml5 datasets

Sample ml5 datasets will be provided for easy use with the examples. They have been collected, cleaned, and in most cases labeled. They can be found under /docs/assets/datasets.

## Other common machine learning datasets

These datasets are often used in machine learning examples. While most are pre-processed, they may be formatted differently from the ml5 datasets.
