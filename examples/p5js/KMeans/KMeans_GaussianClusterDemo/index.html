			<h1>K-Means Clustering</h1>
			  <p> K-Means is a clustering algorithm that groups <strong><em>n</em></strong> observations into <strong><em>k</em></strong> groups. It works well for well-clustered data, and is a great choice if you know the number of groups beforehand.</p>
			  <p>Be aware that K-Means solves for local optima (instead of global), so different iterations may yield different clusters. You can click the same button again to re-run the algorithm and see how the results change.</p>
			<p>The algorithm clusters based on mean points with euclidean distance, so it works best with clusters which are <em>roughly</em> spherical and of <em>roughly</em> even sizes. See <em>Circles</em> and <em>Moons</em> below for examples where these expectations aren't met.</p>
